**User Management System**
A simple full-stack application to create and manage user data. This project demonstrates secure frontend-backend integration and provides a foundation for expanding into a comprehensive user management system.

**Features**
->Create users with a secure backend API.
->Frontend built using React and TailwindCSS.
->Backend powered by Node.js and Express.
->Connected to a MongoDB database.

**Future Enhancements**
This project serves as a foundation for a larger user management system. Future updates might include:

1.Adding user authentication (JWT or OAuth2).
2.Expanding CRUD operations (Update and Delete users).
3.Implementing role-based access control (Admin/Regular users).
4.Deployment to a cloud platform (e.g., Vercel or AWS).
